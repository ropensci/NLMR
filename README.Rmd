# NLMR <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="150" />

**NLMR** is an ``R`` package for simulating **n**eutral **l**andscape **m**odels (NLM). Designed to be a generic framework like [NLMpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nlmpy), it leverages the ability to simulate the most common NLM that are described in the ecological literature. 
**NLMR** builds on the advantages of the **raster** package and returns all simulation as ``RasterLayer`` objects, thus ensuring a direct compatibility to common GIS tasks and a flexible and simple usage.
Furthermore, it simulates NLMs within a self-contained, reproducible framework.

## Installation

Install the release version from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("NLMR")
```

To install the developmental version of **NLMR**, use the following R code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/NLMR")
```

## Example

Each neutral landscape models is simulated with a single function (all starting with `nlm_`) in `NLMR`, e.g.:

```{r eval=FALSE}
random_cluster <- NLMR::nlm_randomcluster(nrow = 100,
                                      ncol = 100,
                                      p    = 0.5,
                                      ai   = c(0.3, 0.6, 0.1),
                                      rescale = FALSE)

random_curdling <- NLMR::nlm_curds(curds = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.6),
                              recursion_steps = c(32, 6, 2))


midpoint_displacememt <- NLMR::nlm_mpd(ncol = 100,
                                 nrow = 100,
                                 roughness = 0.61)
```

## Overview

**NLMR** supplies 15 NLM algorithms, with several options to simulate derivatives of
them. The algorithms differ from each other in spatial auto-correlation, from 
no auto-correlation (random NLM) to a constant gradient (planar gradients):
